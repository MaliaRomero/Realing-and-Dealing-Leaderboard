**MVP Prod 2 Changelog**


As an ambitious player, I want the decks to not run out of cards, so that I can try to get new highscores. (Automatic shuffling of decks once players go through every card- this also fixed bug that kept final card in a deck permanently)


As a player who is confused on what’s going on, I want the bait to change color when I’m low on bait so that I can plan my moves accordingly (If low on bait-less than 2- turn bait color red)


As a player, I want the ui to scale correctly when I play full screen, so that I can read it better (Fixed UI Scaling on authentication and win/lose screen)


As a player, I want the ui to scale correctly when I have trophy points in double digits , so that I can read it better. (Double digit score on new line)


As a player who is confused on what I’m clicking on, I want a darker color when I hover over a button so that I can see where I’m clicking (Darker when hovering over buttons)


As a confused player, I want a how to play screen, so that I know what’s going on. (Implement new how to play screens and button)
